## About This Documentation

This documentation was created by analyzing the original Microsoft GW-BASIC interpreter source code from 1983, which was open-sourced by Microsoft. The assembly code has been carefully examined to extract information about commands, functions, syntax, and behavior patterns.

## How to Use This Documentation

- Start with the Introduction for historical context and overview
- Use the Commands Reference as a quick lookup guide
- Refer to Language Features for detailed syntax information
- Check Programming Examples for practical implementation guidance
- Consult Troubleshooting for common issues and solutions

Each section is designed to be self-contained while building upon concepts introduced in earlier sections.
